In this project we have used many IOT devices.Apart from that we have used PYNQ Platform for both hardware and software implementation.
we have used machine algorithm to estimate the health of power grid as well as life expectancy of transformers based on their characteristics.
Pynq platform is specially used to implement Machine learning algorithms also to control all the IOT modules included in this project.
In the power grid,every transfromer and pole has a transmitter unit. Its major function is to send data to receiver module which is consists of Pynq and other IOT devices. 

Main Modules used:
 1.Xilinx Pynq z2.
 2.Node MCU 1.0
 3.Blynk IOT platform
 4.ACB (Automatic Switch Gear)
Used IDE's:
  1.Jupyter notebook.
  2.Arduino IDE.
